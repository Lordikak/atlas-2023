	"description": "The myplayplanet.net logo is drawn by a small community of technical Minecraft players that builds tnt cannons. This logo is the second attempt on the canvas after a bot wipe of the first one. The original plan was to draw the logo of two rival servers with a heart in the middle but the space and time wasn't enough for that.",
